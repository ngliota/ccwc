# Documentation
There are four options -c, -l, -m, and -w are used to specify what kind of counting operation you want to perform on a text file. Here's what each option does:

-c: Counts the number of bytes in the file. It gives you the total size of the file in bytes.

-l: Counts the number of lines in the file. It gives you the total number of lines present in the file.

-m: Counts the number of characters in the file. It gives you the total number of characters present in the file, including spaces, tabs, and newline characters.

-w: Counts the number of words in the file. It gives you the total number of words present in the file. Words are considered as consecutive sequences of characters separated by whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.).
